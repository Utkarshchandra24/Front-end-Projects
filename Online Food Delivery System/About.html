            <p>In 2019, 2 brothers Rahul and Rakesh started what they thought was going to be a small pizza joint at the corner of Mumbai and Pune in India. The business, staffed by friends and family, served the newest food trend in America. The business thrived instantly and the company took off when its first franchised restaurant opened in Topeka. Now, it is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 100 restaurants in 9 countries.
                
                In 2020, the original Pizza Hut building found a fitting home on Mumbai. It served as a landmark and a source of pride for students.
                
                In 2021, the building was moved again, but this time to the east side of Pune. By turning the building into a museum, it can be enjoyed by all in an interactive way. This story of the pizza place started by two brothers perfectly exemplifies the entrepreneurial spirit of Shockers and Kansans. We hope it will inspire future generations of dreamers and entrepreneurs.
                
                We are proud to be the Home of the Hut.
